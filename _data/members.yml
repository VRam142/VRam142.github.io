  description: 'I finished my B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering at Princeton University, with minors in Quantitative & Computational Biology, and Engineering Biology.
    While at Princeton, I studied in David Botstein''s [Integrated Science Curriculum](https://lsi.princeton.edu/integratedscience); this course sequence
    motivated me to pursue research in quantitative molecular biology. After finishing my undergraduate degree in 2012, I spent a year as a Research Intern / Computational Biologist working in the Bay Area at [Sangamo BioSciences](https://www.sangamo.com/) (now Sangamo Therapeutics). There,
    I worked closely with Jeff Miller and Ed Rebar to develop high-throughput sequencing assays to map potential off-target genomic sites for *de novo* engineered zinc finger and TALE nucleases. I then moved to Seattle, where I completed my Ph.D. in Genome Sciences in Jay Shendure''s lab
    at the University of Washington. In Jay''s lab, I developed several molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I then began my own independent research group as a Sandler Faculty Fellow in the Fall of 2018, and transitioned to an Assistant Professor position at the Gladstone Institute for Data Science & Biotechnology / UCSF Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics in 2021.
    '
# In Jay''s lab, I developed new molecular technologies to study biomolecular phenomena at scale. I first developed RNA Proximity Ligation, a high-throughput method
# to resolve RNA structures transcriptome-wide using proximity ligation and sequencing. I then worked with Andrew Adey, Junyue Cao, Darren Cusanovich, Zhijun Duan, and a bunch of other incredibly talented scientists in our lab and at Illumina
# to co-develop single-cell combinatorial indexing ("sci" sequencing), a methodological approach for molecularly characterizing thousands of single-cells without ever resorting to single-cell isolation. As a graduate student I also developed an interest in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation; I worked closely with Christine Disteche''s lab to apply novel
# bulk- and single-cell sequencing technologies to dissect the dynamics underlying mammalian X chromosome inactivation, wherein one entire X chromosome is heterochromatinized during early female mammalian development.

As a Beckman Scholar, I worked with Matt Sazinsky on engineering novel proteins capable of hydroxylating straight-chain and cyclic carbon compounds. I spent my junior year as a research associate working in the lab of David Lomas at University College London, which inspired me to pursue graduate study in the UK. I subsequently completed a masters in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge in 2018, working with Serena Nik-Zainal to study tumorigenesis through the lens of mutational signatures. While there, I helped develop new statistical models for understanding how DNA damage and repair can shape the tumor genome - which led to a strong interest in how cancer evades and co-opts cellular machinery to survive.

At Duke, I conducted my senior thesis in Anne West’s lab combining CRISPR/Cas9 technology with single-cell readouts of gene expression to study the function of neuronal activity-dependent enhancers.
# After graduation, I moved to Boston and worked as a tech in Mike Greenberg’s lab at Harvard Medical School. There, I studied how sequence changes at transcription factor binding motifs contribute to species-specific patterns of gene transcription in the human retina and developing brain. I joined the Program in Neuroscience (PiN) in 2017 and I continued as a Ph.D. student in Mike’s lab. My graduate work focused on using a genetic approach to explore the determinants of enhancer function, focusing on the role of Ras/MAPK signaling and AP-1 TFs in establishing cell type-specific gene regulatory landscapes. More specifically, I leveraged naturally occurring genetic variation between inbred mouse strains to perform a large-scale mutagenesis screen of enhancer sequences in their native chromatin state.
# I started as a postdoc in the Ramani lab in 2022, where I am interested in employing single-molecule methods to study the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin remodelers in defining genome organization. In particular, I am looking to study how nucleosome structure is established in endoderm development, with an emphasis on understanding how these processes go awry in disease"

My undergraduate research experience focused on the physiological underpinnings of memory and Alzheimer’s disease in mouse model systems. From there, I joined the Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics graduate group at the University of Pennsylvania and began my PhD in the lab of Dr. Mitch Lazar. My work there interrogated the interplay between transcription and physiology by studying the role of the histone deacetylase corepressors NCoR1/2 in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. I uncovered a surprising function for these corepressors in mediating inflammation using genetic mouse models, RNA-sequencing, and ChIP-sequencing methods.
I joined the Ramani lab in 2022 and aim to combine my knowledge of physiology and nuclear receptor biology with cutting-edge methods of sequencing and chromatin mapping to understand the basic molecular biology behind tissue development and function. I’m looking forward to expanding my skills in computational biology and biochemistry to complement this work.

  description: "After studying Pharmaceutical Sciences, Molecular Biology, and Mathematics at Drake University in Iowa, I headed west to join the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Washington in 2010. I did my PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology with Steve Henikoff at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I contributed to the development of a number of molecular tools for high-resolution chromatin profiling including techniques for purifying cell type-specific nuclei from whole animals (INTACT), mapping transcription factor binding sites on native chromatin (ORGANIC), and mapping genomic binding of DNA-binding proteins using targeted endogenous cleavage (ChEC-seq). We applied these approaches to better characterize transcription factor binding and understand targeting of Polycomb-mediated repression (with Guillaume Orsi and Kami Ahmad). I also worked with Jeetu Thakur and Paul Talbert to define recently evolved functional alpha satellite dimers at human centromeres and investigate short repeats at Drosophila centromeres. Our analysis of centromeric satellites from a variety of species also suggested a role for non-B-form DNA structures in templating centromere identity.


  In 2019, I joined the Pediatrics Residency Program at Stanford University / Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. As a physician and basic scientist, I hope to work with the Ramani lab to dissect gene dysregulation in human disease through novel molecular technologies."

Following graduation, I worked with Dr. Melissa Harrison at the University of Wisconsin – Madison as a research specialist. The Harrison lab uses the early Drosophila embryo as a model system for studying epigenetic reprogramming and cell fate determinism across development.

Continuing my interest in epigenetic regulation of cell-fate decisions and gene activation, I joined the Ramani lab in Spring 2024. My work as a postdoc aims to address fundamental questions regarding the transcriptional responses to TF binding and disentangle the effects of a myriad of context- dependent interactions.
